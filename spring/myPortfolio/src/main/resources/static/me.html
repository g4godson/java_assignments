		    <p><b>Why Coding Dojo:</b> I decided to spend my summer learning to code because I wanted to dedicate my time to learning a practical and useful skill that I have never had any exposure to before. Before Coding Dojo, I had no idea if I would even like coding or how it worked, and in just 3 weeks, I have watched myself grasp concepts which I thought were beyond me. I get a thrill from watching myself grow and learn, and coding is gratifying because each small problem solved is like a small reward, motivating me to continue. I had begun to self-teach myself Python, but it was difficult to move at a pace which I wanted to since I was also taking classes in university, so when the summer came, I knew I wanted to invest time in learning to code. So far, I have been thoroughly enjoying my time with my cohort and my instructors, and I can't wait to see where the rest of the bootcamp and beyond takes me.</p>
